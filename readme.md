# Solution Engine Python SDK

This SDK allows applications to do basic read and write operations of Devices, Components and DataItems on a network routable Soluton Engine.

It currently uses the MTConnect-pattern API (xml-based) from Engine for all of its work.

Python 3 is required for use.

## Installing

The SDK is [availble directly from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/solutionfamily/).

Use `pip3` to install to your environment.

```
sudo apt-get install libxslt-dev
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
sudo pip install solutionfamily
```
